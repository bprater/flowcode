# Tower Defense Mob Ideas

## ü¶á Flying Mobs
- **Bat Swarm**: Small, fast flying enemies that bypass ground-based obstacles and take alternative air routes
- **Flying Eyeball**: Winged eyeball that hovers above the path, harder to hit but more vulnerable to lightning towers
- **Drone Scout**: Mechanical flying unit that moves erratically and has shield regeneration

## üõ°Ô∏è Armored/Special Defense Mobs
- **Armored Cyclops**: Single large eye with metallic armor plating - takes reduced damage from certain tower types
- **Mirror Eye**: Reflective eyeball that has a chance to reflect projectiles back at towers
- **Phase Walker**: Ghostly eyeball that can briefly become translucent and pass through towers

## üë• Group/Spawning Mobs
- **Mother Eye**: Large eyeball that splits into 2-3 smaller eyeballs when killed
- **Eyeball Cluster**: Group of connected small eyes that move together but can be separated by area damage
- **Spawner**: Stationary eyeball that periodically creates new enemies until destroyed

## ‚ö° Elemental/Status Effect Mobs
- **Frost Eye**: Blue-tinted eyeball that slows nearby towers when it dies
- **Fire Eye**: Red eyeball that leaves burning trail, damaging towers it passes near
- **Electric Eye**: Charged eyeball that disables towers briefly when hit by lightning

## üèÉ Movement Variant Mobs
- **Speed Demon**: Very fast small eyeball with low health
- **Tank Eye**: Massive slow eyeball with enormous health pool
- **Teleporter**: Eyeball that occasionally jumps forward along the path
- **Backwards Walker**: Eyeball that moves backwards, confusing tower targeting

## üé≠ Unique Behavior Mobs
- **Invisible Stalker**: Eyeball that turns invisible periodically, only visible when attacking or near certain towers
- **Healer Eye**: Green eyeball that slowly heals nearby damaged enemies
- **Jammer**: Eyeball that reduces tower range/accuracy when nearby
- **Berserker**: Gets faster and more dangerous as its health decreases

## üåü Boss-Level Mobs
- **Cyclops King**: Huge single eye with multiple attack phases and special abilities
- **Eye of the Storm**: Massive eyeball surrounded by smaller orbiting eyes
- **Ancient Watcher**: Old, scarred eyeball with very high health and immunity to certain damage types

## Implementation Notes
Each mob type could have:
- **Unique iris colors/patterns** for visual distinction
- **Different death effects** (ice shatter, electric zap, etc.)
- **Special sounds** for movement and death
- **Tactical counters** - certain towers more/less effective against specific mobs

## Priority Implementation
Recommended starting mobs for immediate strategic variety:
1. **Speed Demon** - Fast, low health
2. **Tank Eye** - Slow, high health  
3. **Armored Cyclops** - Damage resistance
